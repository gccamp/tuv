1There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was sincere and upright, God-fearing and shunning evil.
2Now seven sons and three daughters were born to him.
3His livestock consisted of seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of cattle, five hundred she- donkeys, and very much production; and the man was greater than all the children of the East.
4Now his sons would go and make a feast in each one's house on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
5Now it would come about when the cycle of the feasting days would be over, that Job would send and summon them, and offer up burnt-offerings early in the morning burnt- offerings according to the number of all of them, for Job said, "Perhaps my sons have sinned and blasphemed God in their hearts." So would Job do all the days.
6Now the day came about, and the angels of God came to stand beside the Lord, and the Adversary, too, came among them.
7The Lord said to the Adversary, "Where are you coming from?" And the Adversary answered the Lord and said, "From going to and fro on the earth and from walking in it."
8Now the Lord said to the Adversary, "Have you paid attention to My servant Job? For there is none like him on earth, a sincere and upright man, God-fearing and shunning evil."
9And the Adversary answered the Lord and said, "Does Job fear God for nothing?
10Haven't You made a hedge around him, his household, and all that he has on all sides? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock has spread out in the land.
11But now, stretch forth Your hand and touch all that he has, will he not blaspheme You to Your face?"
12Now the Lord said to the Adversary, "Behold, all that he has is in your hands; only upon him do not stretch forth your hand." Now the Adversary left the presence of the Lord.
13Now the day came about that his sons and daughters were dining and drinking wine at the home of their firstborn brother,
14and a messenger came to Job and said, "The cattle were plowing, and the she-donkeys were grazing beside them,
15and Sheba fell upon them and took them, and they slew the youths by the sword, and only I alone escaped to tell you."
16This one was still talking, and another one came and said, "A tremendous fire fell from heaven and burned the flocks and the youths and consumed them; only I alone escaped to tell you."
17This one was still talking, and another one came and said, "Chaldeans formed three bands, spread out on the camels and took them, and slew the youths with the sword, and only I alone escaped to tell you."
18While this one was still talking, another one came and said, "Your sons and daughters were dining and drinking wine at the home of their firstborn brother,
19when, behold, a great wind came from the other side of the desert, and struck the four corners of the house; it fell upon the youths, who died, and only I alone escaped to tell you."
20Then Job stood up, and rent his robe and tore his hair; then he fell to the ground and prostrated himself.
21And he said, "From my mother's womb, I emerged naked, and I will return there naked. The Lord gave and the Lord took; may the name of the Lord be blessed."
22Despite all this, Job did not sin, neither did he ascribe unseemliness to God.
